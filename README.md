# Sales-Analysis:

This visualization project analyzes the Sales Dataset. 

- This project aims to apply data analysis techniques to help the sales department in a company take the right decisions based on the trends of product sales and analyze customer behavior.

# Here are the steps I have walking through the project:

1- Data exploration and cleansing using Power Query.

2- Data Modeling: Galaxy schema was used to implement the DWH model as I have three separate fact tables (Sales - Forecast - Customer Group): 
Tables are subdivided into fact and dimensional to understand the relationship between them. 

3- Building the dashboard using Microsoft Power BI.

# Customer Classification:

The customer evaluated through 3 main criteria:

1- Recency: how recent the last transaction is.

2- Frequency: how many times the customer has bought from our store.

3- Monetary: how much each customer has paid for our products.

Then, I ranked them through those criterias.
